# landing-page
### A landing page webpage together with a Source webpage, designed with HTML and CSS.

Built on top of an idea within "The Odin Project"[^1], I made up an electricity company that specializes on providing electricity through renewable energies and made a landing page for that company. I felt like just rebuilding a template would not only be boring but would also prevent me from trying out my own ideas and presenting them. 

> So here we are.
