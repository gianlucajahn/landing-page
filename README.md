# landing-page
A landing page webpage together with a Source webpage, designed with HTML and CSS.

Built on top of an idea within "The Odin Project", I made up an electricity company that specializes on providing electricity through renewable energies and made a landing page for that company. I felt like just rebuilding a template would not only be boring but would also prevent me from trying out my own ideas and presenting them, so here we are.

You can view the landing page live soon, I'll put the link here as soon as it is uploaded to it's own GitHub page! ðŸ”—
